## Script Explanation
The idea with the DrawOnClick.cs Script is to be able to click on a quad gameobject, draw a white circle on the attached texture at the clicked position and then send that texture data into the shader so that texture data is then used to calculate normals to simulate a fluid. The end result is then a ketchup on top of a cheese in a hamburguer :). The Idea is to improve this code to then use it further for more things like snow interactions some simpler mud, sand simulations / footsteps, etc...
